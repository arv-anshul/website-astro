## Week 10 Journal

❌ No extra learnings. See [2024 February](02.md#week-10-journal)

## Week 11 Journal

### Learning

1. [Zed]: Tried Zed code editor and I feel promising to adapt.
2. [arv-anshul/dotfiles]: Updated `dotfiles`, inspired by [corey/dotfiles].
3. [brew]: Learned some new things in `brew` cli.
   - `brew autoremove`: Uninstall formulae that were only installed as a dependency of another formula and are now no
     longer needed.
   - `brew deps`: Show dependencies for formula. When given multiple formula arguments, show the intersection of
     dependencies for each formula. By default, deps shows all required and recommended dependencies.
4. [family-tree]: New project to "Create family tree using python and export it as JSON or mermaid format". Written
   tests too.
5. [md-badges]: **CANCELLED** A CLI tool to query [shields.io](https://shields.io) badges simpleicons in a batch.
   - I find it hard and irritating to query each badge on [badges.pages.dev](https://badges.pages.dev/) website. I want
     to query/select all required badges at once.
6. **Schema Writting for JSON**:
   - Learned how to write schema for `json`, `yaml` and `toml` files.
   - Learning to define schema for the personal website's
     [`docs/data/render_yaml`](https://github.com/arv-anshul/arv-anshul.github.io/tree/main/docs/data/render_yaml)
     folder's YAML files.
   - Watched this video by **NeuralNine**:
     [JSON Schema Validation in Python: Bring Structure Into JSON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ViNZpTaKE)
   - Check the schemas: `projects_index-schema.json` and `other_projects-schema.json`
7. [arv-anshul/campusx]:
   - Wrote python scripts to download course's resources from internet and store them in GitHub repo itself.
   - Also added this project on [website](https://arv-anshul.github.io/projects/campusx).

### Thoughts

1. [Zed] code editor is just great and I want to use it full time but it lacks many features which are very heavy to
   fulfil. I want features like 🥇 **Extensions**, 🥈 **Jupyter Notebook**, 🥉 **Git SCM UI** and more.
2. [stats]: Amazing app for MacOS which let you display your CPU, RAM, Network Usage, etc in menu bar. I knew about it
   from a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/GK7zLYAXdDs). I have installed an app from App Store to display my Network
   Usage in menu bar after a lot of searching on web.
3. [arv-anshul/diary]: Cleaning of the diary.
   - Remove unnecessary files and notes.
   - Combine the important one and publish them as blog on [arv-anshul.github.io] like **FastAPI** and **Data Science**
     notes.
   - Write & Update conventions of every notes and create templates for them.

## Week 12 Journal

### Learning

1. [arv-anshul.github.io]
   - Update some componet's layouts of website i.e. Grid Cards, Code Blocks, Buttons.
   - Also, figured-out how to integrate [devicons](https://devicon.dev) as like emoji.
2. [arv-anshul/diary]
   - Migrate `diary` notes as blog on website.
   - Trying to drop [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md) for my diary entry and want to use `mkdocs` (with basic
     functionalities) for dairy entry.
   - Successfully migrated [arv-anshul/diary] from Obsidian to `mkdocs`. Compare releases
     [`v1.0.0...v1.1.0`](https://github.com/arv-anshul/diary/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0).
   - Wrote custom snippets for Dev Journal(s) and Thoughts entries in VSCode.
3. [arv-anshul/campusx]
   - Modified scripts to infer filename from response's headers. Filename is available in `"content-disposition"`
     headers key.
   - See new ["Release v0.8.0: Infer resources filename"](https://github.com/arv-anshul/campusx/releases/v0.8.0) on
     GitHub.
4. [blog]
   - [Tree VS Regression Models](https://arv-anshul.github.io/blog/tree-vs-regression-models)

### Thoughts

1. :question: **Should I drop Obsidian for my diary entry?**
   - (NO) because Obsidian comes with many other functionalities like Canvas, Extensions, Templates.
   - (NO) because Obsidian is made for managing notes and documents (which is a very big plus+ point).
   - (YES) because `mkdocs` will work as a website which you can make public (if you wish for).
   - (YES) because you doesn't have to care about a separate app's constraints (`obsidian.app`).
2. [Setting up tags - Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-tags/)
   - Learn how to setup tags (as pro).
   - Also, figure out how does `squidfunk` render those "versions", "default values", "sponsors only" cool badges.
   - Also see this [web page](https://mkdocs-material.github.io/examples/tags/)
     - There is an example for `tags` plugin.
     - Learn how did this works?
3. [raycast]
   - Amazing app for developers. Just use keyboard to perform all important tasks.
   - **Best Features**: Floating Notes, Snippets, Keyboard Shortcuts, :tada: Confetti, Window Management, Shut Down
   - **Best Extensions**: Arc, Shell Command, Google Translate, Perplexity
   - I have created some snippets which helps me to write them very easily like:
     - `!gha`: <https://github.com/arv-anshul>
     - `!web`: <https://arv-anshul.github.io>
     - `!linkedin`:

     ```text
     🔗 Github Profile: https://github.com/arv-anshul
     🔗 Personal Projects: https://arv-anshul.github.io/projects
     🔗 Website: https://arv-anshul.github.io
     🔗 Blogs: https://arv-anshul.github.io/blog

     🙏 Thank You!
     ```

   - :disappointed: But it takes too much memory approx. ~300MB in RAM.

## Week 13 Journal

### Learning

1. [pw-api](https://github.com/arv-anshul/pw-api)
   - The project doesn't works now due to some major changes in [pwskills.com](https://pwskills.com) website's APIs.
   - Added a warning regarding this in [README.md](https://github.com/arv-anshul/pw-api#readme)
2. [notebooks/spotify-analysis/pl-tracks-using-api.ipynb](https://github.com/arv-anshul/notebooks/tree/main/spotify-analysis/pl-tracks-using-api.ipynb)
   - I want to analyse the **Golden Era 🎵** playlist by @Pushpam on Spotify. To reduce the tracks count because it
     consists ~300 tracks.
   - I've used Spotify Web API to fetch data of the playlist.
3. **Co-author a Git Commit**
   - You can co-author a git commit by specifying the author name and email in commit body.

   ```bash
   ✨ Learn commit co-authoring  # Commit message

   Co-authored by: arv-anshul <arv.anshul.1864@gmail.com>  # Specify who co-authored this
   ```

4. [blog/hypothesis-testing-introduction](https://arv-anshul.github.io/blog/hypothesis-testing-introduction)
   - Published new blog on Hypothesis Testing.

### Thoughts

- [DeepLearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai)
  - This website has some **free short course around LLMs and GenAI**.
