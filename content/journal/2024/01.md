## Week 1: Dev Journal of January

### Learning

1. **`ruff`**: An amazing python code linter and formatter with very high performance, written in Rust.
   - Ruff GitHub: <https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff>
2. **`Docker`**: Containerise your application.
   - You can containerise multiple apps using `docker-compose`.
   - There are many concepts in docker I have learned **Docker Volumes, Port Expose, Environment Variables
     Initialisation**. Left out concepts: **Docker Networking, Docker Hub, etc.**
3. **`pyproject.toml`**: New way to configure you Python project.
   - I used this to configure my `ruff` configs.
   - I have not completely learned this configs management file exclusively regarding python projects.
4. Because this is the first week of the year, I have reviewed my configuration files from GitHub repository and GitHub
   Gist.

### Thoughts

1. Ruff is amazing because it combines both linting and formatting together with its amazing performance speed ⚡.
2. Docker makes your application very easy to setup for other developer.
3. Learning MLOps is very iterative, disgusting, and many more. But when you learn it you will be like **"WOW! What a
   service, product, concept."**

## Week 2: Dev Journal of January

### Learning

1. **VSCode UI Settings**: Explore settings in VS Code IDE which will modify its UI colour (mainly).
2. **Discussed Cold Turkey Blocker issue on Windows**: Windows have the path related issue.
   [Repository](https://github.com/arv-anshul/ColdTurkeyBlocker-Pro) |
   [GH2](https://github.com/arv-anshul/ColdTurkeyBlocker-Pro/issues/2)
3. **Aggregation Pipeline in MongoDB**: Used aggregation pipeline in my project which makes it easy to deal with data. I
   don't explicitly merging the datasets in the script.
   - [Commit](https://github.com/arv-anshul/yt-watch-history/commit/291ffdf796828ec301c0f8058ed1d2b27c73c517) where I
     did this in my [yt-watch-history](https://github.com/arv-anshul/yt-watch-history) project.

### Thoughts

1. Creating ML system is very tedious. I am trying to understand how to integrate these amazing tools in this. ALthough,
   I am able to train and do prediction with my ML Model but I am not satisfied with my approach. Thats why I am
   learning new ways to design these systems.

## Week 3: Dev Journal of January

### Learning

1. **`mkdocs-material`**: I have this amazing documentation maker using `.md` files in 1 day (almost). You can see my
   personal website hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://arv-anshul.github.io).
2. **Freelance**: [@theabhinav002](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theabhinav002) queried to create #web-scrapping APIs for
   real estate website.
   - I have accepted the offer.
   - Now, I am creating the web-scrapper for [housing.com](https://housing.com).
3. [**yt-watch-history**](https://github.com/arv-anshul/yt-watch-history): I have been working around **Channel
   Recommendation System** which recommend channels on the basis of channel's videos title and tags. However, I have
   completely build the model architecture but I wonder to put it in a pipeline to make it more concise to use and
   define.
   - I have discussed this system with [@arpitpatel01](https://github.com/arpitpatel01).

### Thoughts

1. Always write your thoughts whichever things you are working on because it helps you to understand your thoughts and
   also helps you that how you explain your things or projects.
2. While my freelancing process I feel like I am at my full potential and I've almost completed the project in 3-4 days.
   I have written code to scrape housing.com. Also created APIs around it using `FastAPI` framework.

## Week 4: Dev Journal of January

### Learning

1. [**`yt-watch-history`**](https://github.com/arv-anshul/yt-watch-history): This week I spend all the time on
   refactoring and understanding my project. It feels very difficult to work on but I made my mind and say that here **I
   can push and pass my limits**.
2. **Custom Transformers using `sklearn` API**: I have not totally learned how to create a custom transformer using
   `sklearn` API but I got the idea of it how to use it. Also, I have wrote some custom classes and tested it (it works
   well).
3. **New Realease**: I have released [`v0.0.1`](https://github.com/arv-anshul/yt-watch-history/releases/tags/v0.0.1) of
   `yt-watch-history` project.

### Thoughts

1. You can create your custom transformer using `sklearn` and then put them into a pipeline which works like magic.
2. I am going to break my limit with this project ([`yt-watch-history`](https://github.com/arv-anshul/yt-watch-history))
   because in this I am using too many new concepts like Docker, MLFlow, Custom `sklearn` transformers (recently). Now,
   I am thinking about **AWS** 🤩.

## Week 5: Dev Journal of January

### Learning

1. **[`learnwith.campusx.in`](https://learnwith.campusx.in)**: I have written a script which goes through the html of
   the website and using the `cookies` it fetches the resources which were provided in the videos' description.
2. **Learning ML Concepts**: I have learned how **Gini Impurity/Index** works by practicing it on paper with my hand and
   pencil. **This helps me a lot and I (sort of) figured out, how should I learn things in ML.**
3. **Blog on Decision Tree**: I published a blog on decision tree on my
   [website](https://arv-anshul.github.io/blog/category/ml/).

### Thoughts

1. **Frustration**: In these few days, I am not feeling that inspiration while doing anything. I feel frustrated and
   difficult to focus on things. It is like something which I can't express but it is bad for me.
