## Week 18 Journal

1. Continue working on [credit-modeling] project with Sambhav.
   - Sambhav wrote [documentation](https://arv-anshul.github.io/project/credit-modeling) of this project.
   - Added the project documentation in repo too. The documentation PDF is saved after it converted into my website's
     page.
2. Start working on [freeapi-py] project. Also shared the project on **Hitesh Chaudhary's Discord Server**.
   - Added `/todo`, `/quote`, `/gh` routes.
   - Posted [freeapi-py] project on
     [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7192135714594000896/).
3. Rahul recommended an amazing YouTube channel [**@probabl_ai**](https://www.youtube.com/@probabl_ai) which goes deep
   inside the libraries (`scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `polars`, `duckdb`) code.
4. After attending the DSMP 2.0 session on **"Project Based Interview Session"** _(by Rohan Azad)_, I knew many
   important rules and conventions regarging Interviews.
   - **Know yourself** so that you can introduce yourself very well without jargons for approx. 1.5 minutes to 2
     minutes.
   - **Know your projects** because you have to explain it very well any process/concept of your project can be asked by
     interviewers. You've to explain your project for 30 to 40 minutes.
   - **Know the basics** interviewers will try to trick you with them.
5. I woke up at 4 AM and immediately called my friends, Priyanshu, Suraj, Binam, and Pushpam. After a quick chat, we
   left home at 4:30 AM to play cricket on the PP School ground.

## Week 19 Journal

1. Re-think [md_badges.py] CLI tool. Now it works very well.
2. `curl -sSL url_to_file.py | python - arg1 arg2 arg3`
3. LinkedIn post on [ARC Browser] also requested to download it with my referral link.
4. Opened a new discussion [#2] in [arv-anshul.github.io] github repository.
5. Wrote a new article [/ref/resume-tips].

## Week 20 Journal

1. Restart the [yt-watch-history] project as [yt-watch-history-v2].

   - Thinking the whole process from scratch, draw some digrams on **app.eraser.io**.
   - Copied the code of `api/` and `ml/` but writing the code for **frontend** from scratch.

2. Creating a website for [Rahul] using [mkdocs-material]. [Check it out here](https://rahulkr30.github.io).

3. :sparkles: Added recommendation pages for **Music, Movies, Shows and Anime** on the website.

   - First, I've decided to maintain them here in diary but I got a solution which hide those page from website and at
     the same they are explicitly accessible from URL.

   <figure markdown>

   | Page               | URL                                                                  |
   | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Music**          | [`/music`](https://arv-anshul.github.io/music)                       |
   | **Movies & Shows** | [`/movies-and-shows`](https://arv-anshul.github.io/movies-and-shows) |
   | **Anime**          | [`/anime`](https://arv-anshul.github.io/anime)                       |

   </figure>

4. Disable, Dependendant Bot :robot: analysis on [yt-watch-history] repository.

5. Assign keyboard shortcut to raycast's emoji extension. Now pasting is very awesome :partying_face:.

6. Found the way to import my CSS and JavaScript files to add them in `mkdocs.yaml`.

   - It helps to sync all the extra and custom CSS/JS files from main website where I maintin them.

7. Changed battries of Mouse and Keyboard on **18 May, 2024**.

   ```yaml
   mouse:
     old:
       name: Eveready
       price: ₹30
       installed_on: 2023-12-02
     new:
       name: Nippo
       price: ₹10
       installed_on: 2024-05-18
   keyboard:
     old:
       name: Duracell
       price: included in box
       installed_on: on purchase date
     new:
       name: Nippo
       price: ₹10
       installed_on: 2024-05-18
   ```

## Week 21 Journal

1. Updated the GitHub Profile
   [README](https://github.com/arv-anshul/arv-anshul/blob/877a8c5813dda66b2bf8cbb667ff9527ed3d22dd/README.md?plain=1#L3-L5).
   - Shorten the About Me section.
2. [yt-watch-history-v2]
   - Created more diagrams.
   - Now, download ML Model from URL _(if not exists)_.
3. **Custom Stylus Themes**: I customize website's UI using [stylus extension] and for that I've to write CSS. So I'm
   going upload all those `.user.css` custom CSS in GitHub repo.
   - **Customized**: youtube.com, gemini.google.com, chatgpt.com, open.spotify.com, linkedin.com and more.
   - BTW, I also use [ARC Boost] for quick customization but I it doesn't give me ability to export the customization in
     CSS format.
4. This week update:
   - Painting in my room took 2 Days.
   - Installing Gypsum False Celling in my room disturb the daytime.
5. Get the current week number with this python command.

```bash
# using bash
echo "Current week number is $(date +%V)."

# using python
python -c "from datetime import date; print(f'Current week number is {date.today().isocalendar()[1]}.')"
```

1. Opened issues in `zed`, `simpleicons`, `CampusX-Course` repositories. Check my [github activity].
2. Used [mkdocs-redirects] plugin in website repo. I found it very helpful and easy to use 😇.
3. A [github repo](https://github.com/Yash-Kavaiya/CampusX-courses) which contains materials of **CampusX Free
   Courses**.

## Week 22 Journal

1. New release for [campusx repo] (previously know as `campusx-dsmp` repo)

   - See the release note for [`v0.11.0`](https://github.com/arv-anshul/campusx/releases/v0.11.0)

2. Learned [Taskfile] (alternative to Makefile). Taskfile is better, easy, intuitive to use than Makefile.

   - Pushed global `Taskfile.yaml` into [dotfiles] repository.

3. [Marimo] is a alternative to Jupyter Notebooks.

   - I came to about it while juggling between Zed isuess.
   - Also, [Marimo has a blog] where they discussed that how Marimo has overhead on Jupyter Notebooks.

4. After using [Marimo]:

   - It has very functioning than Jupyter Notebooks because Marimo works on `.py` files instead of `.ipynb` files.
   - It has better markdown support. You can natively pin the python vars in MDs.
   - It has builtin support to convert a Jupyter notebook or Markdown file to a marimo script.
   - You can use marimo but it has long learning curve.
   - BTW, currently I uses VSCode builtin Notebooks but looking lokking forward to switch to Zed (when they supports
     it).
   - Currently, I have no plans to switch to [Marimo].

5. There is a big problem, I am facing with [Taskfile].

   Here, when you run Taskfile from different dir while referring to another Taskfile (present in different dir) with
   `-t` or `-d` flag, it will not take reference of `pwd` instead take reference of dir where the Taskfile present.

   This is a big negative for me because I've defined a global Taskfile through which I ran many useful and important
   commands.

   ```bash
   $ pwd
   ~/Developer/diary
   $ task -t ~/Developer/dotfiles/Taskfile.yaml pc-all
   task: [pc-all] pwd
   ~/Developer/dotfiles
   task: [pc-all] pre-commit run --all-files
   An error has occurred: InvalidConfigError:
   =====> .pre-commit-config.yaml is not a file
   Check the log at ~/.cache/pre-commit/pre-commit.log
   task: Failed to run task "pc-all": exit status 1
   ```

   Previously, I uses **Makefile** for this and there it works fine.

   ```bash
   $ pwd
   ~/Developer/diary
   $ make -f ~/Developer/Makefile pc-all
   # works fine...
   ```
