## Week 14 Journal

### Learning

1. [Rust]
   - Learning Rust from YouTube and Rust Books.
   - Created [arv-anshul/thrust] repo where I practice Rust by creating programs.
   - **End of Week:** I decided to leave Rust behind and starts focusing on ML and DL. :wink:

### Thoughts

1. [Rust]
   - :tada: Finally, finally, finally.
   - Read [my thoughts on rust](/blog/rust-lang).
2. [CampusX - Short Courses](https://learnwith.campusx.in/s/store)
   - Just great to know that Nitish Sir is launching approx. 10 New Short Courses where other teachers will teaches some
     concepts in deep and also build projects using those concepts.
   - Also, these short courses is free and for lifetime.
   - I think it's just like short courses by [Deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai/short-courses).
3. [hey-wcowin.md]
   - I met [@Wcowin](https://github.com/Wcowin) and written something about him.

## Week 15 Journal

### Learning

1. [mkdocs - `nav`](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#nav)
   - Create multiple references of same notes in `mkdocs.yaml`'s `nav` field and then it gets render as it is written.
     Checkout the [official documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#nav).
   - Also checkout website's [`mkdocs.yaml`](https://github.com/arv-anshul/arv-anshul.github.io/tree/main/mkdocs.yaml)
     file's `nav` field.
2. [Anshul Raj Verma - Friends](https://arv-anshul.github.io/friends)
   - Created a Friends page on website using where I'll put my friends info.
   - The info were rendered from
     [`yaml`](https://github.com/arv-anshul/arv-anshul.github.io/tree/main/docs/data/render_yaml/friends.yaml) file
     using [`mkdocs-markdownextradata-plugin`](https://pypi.org/p/mkdocs-markdownextradata-plugin).

### Thoughts

1. `mkdocs-edges`
   - Planning to write a `plugin` for `mkdocs` using which users are able to customize their sites layout (rounded
     edges).
2. [Fresher Getting 17 LPA Data Scientist Job From Tier 3 College | Story of Tarun Chauhan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR24M5ns-YY)
   - Connect with Tarun on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tarun-chauhan-719a9b221)
   - After watching this video; I have to make better notes from CampusX videos which helps me to remember those
     concepts workings and theory.

## Week 16 Journal

1. [Change ARC Browser Icon - GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/gabe565/9654eea08a9f6c7c1f593049e5bed243)

2. [Basics of Statistics for ML](https://arv-anshul.github.io/blog/basics-of-statistics): New blog to learn basic
   statistics for Machie Learning. Explained Descriptive and Inferential Statistics.

3. **Username Dilemma**

   - I am changing my username from (`arv-anshul`/`arv_anshul`) to (`batook`/`batookm`) because it is of one word, no
     separation (`-`/`_`) in between.
   - I have already changed username of Telegram, Discord and Instagram.

   <figure markdown>

   |                  Platform                   |     ID     |
   | :-----------------------------------------: | :--------: |
   |                   Discord                   | `batookm`  |
   |      [Telegram](https://t.me/batookm)       | `batookm`  |
   | [Instagram](https://instagram.com/_batookm) | `_batookm` |

   </figure>

   - ~~:thinking: Thinking to change GitHub username too but that is too overwhelming.~~
   - I am not going to change GitHub and LinkedIn username because `arv-anshul` is my professional username and `batook`
     is my nick-username. If I made my X _(formally Twitter)_ then I'll keep my username as **`batook`** :sunglasses:.

4. [freeapi.app] - By Hitesh Choudhary :sunglasses:

   - I am thinking to recreate this in Python using **FastAPI** as `freeapi-py`.
   - I first need to tackle:
     - How to handle `limit` query?
     - How to use MongoDB from localhost and Docker?

5. [ruff/server]

   - Yet another banger from **Astral devs**.
   - Read blog on [`ruff server`](https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.4.0).

6. Me and Rahul Bhaiya are started working on that [yt-watch-history] project **but from scratch**.

7. Write about "How to introduce yourself?".

8. Maintain a page where you write your achievement also express your thoughts on them.
