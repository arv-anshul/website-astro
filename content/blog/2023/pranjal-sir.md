> On 27 November, 2023 I am learning MLOps with CampusX DSMP 2.0 Course from [@PranjalSir](https://github.com/PranY).

He introduced us MLOps in a very interesting way with a analogy of **Organising a Concert for World Cup Final**. You can
read [this notebook](https://github.com/arv-anshul/campusx-mlops) to see that beautiful analogy to get the high level
idea about MLOps.

In MLOps, you have to learn many different tools to manage your codes, data, ML models and to visualize the model
performance and many different things. Tools like Git, DVC, CookieCutter, DataBases, Cloud Services, Jira, Prometheus,
Grafana, etc.
