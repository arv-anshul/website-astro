# Welcome to Markdown!

Markdown is a **lightweight markup language** that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

## What you can do:

- Create **bold** and *italic* text
- Add [links](./test-md) or just bare link https://github.com/arv-anshul
- Make lists and tables
- Make ~~strikthrough~~, ~strike~.
- Insert code: `console.log('Hello World!')`

### Code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```js showLineNumbers /greet/
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('Markdown'));
```

```py title="main.py"
import polars as pl

df = pl.read_csv("test.csv")
display(df.head(5))
```

### Tables are easy too:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Simple | Easy to learn |
| Powerful | Rich formatting |
| Universal | Works everywhere |

> **Tip:** This is just a preview! Try the full editor for more features like real-time sync, export options, and advanced syntax support.
