I used to maintain my [diary] with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) app. And recently I have learned [mkdocs-material]
which is used to create static website using markdown files only.

Obsidian is made to use it as a notes/documents management tool/app but I am just writing my thoughts and journals,
nothing else. And for this I can also use VSCode or any other editor to write notes in markdown format. That's when I
know about [mkdocs-material] and I fall for it :heart:.

When I decided to migrate my notes I have lots of notes regarding **My Projects, Data Science, FastAPI and more**. So I
have to decide whether to remove them or keep them, so I decided to merge the similar one and publish them as
[blogs on the website](https://arv-anshul.github.io/blog/archive/2024/03).

**Merged Notes as Blogs**

1. :adhesive_bandage: [Regularization in ML](https://arv-anshul.github.io/blog/regularization-in-ml)
2. [Handle Outliers - Univariate](https://arv-anshul.github.io/blog/outlier-univariate)
3. [Learn FastAPI](https://arv-anshul.github.io/blog/learn-fastapi)
4. [Learn Docker](https://arv-anshul.github.io/blog/learn-docker)

I have published most of the notes as blog except **My Projects notes** which contains the rough works which I used to
do while creating projects. So I completely :fire: removed them and decided to maintain them
[on the website as projects notes](https://arv-anshul.github.io/projects).

If you want to see how the [diary] looks while I am [maintaining it with obsidian][diary/v1.0.0]. You can also see My
Projects Notes there.
