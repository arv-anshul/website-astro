Joined LeapX.ai as Data Science Intern from 27 June, 2024 for 3 months.

## LeapX Projects

Project done while working with LeapX as Data Science Intern.

### Properties Scraper

Project scrapes data from Housing.com website and dump into MongoDB after basic transformation using Polars, I've used
Scrapy to scrape data. Wrote a python script which automate the process of scraping multiple city in one go.

### Housing Dashboard

A dashboard which shows affluent areas of a city after applying clustering on the real estate data of the city.

- Uses Taipy framework to create dashboard.
- Fetch properties data from MongoDB.
- Perform clustering and plot circles on map of selected city with its _affluence rank_ and other metrics.
- Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.

### :llama: Ad Campaign Bot

A Facebook Ads Campaign Bot powered by OpenAI LLMs where users can query their campaign related questions.

- Bot is flexible enough to answer user's query on multiple camping data format such as _daily or hourly campaign data_.
- Bot can also display graphs/plots related to each query (with some limitations).

### Campaign Dashboard

Streamlit dashboard to show insights around Facebook Ads Campaign using Data Analysis and charts using campaign metrics
like CTL, CPM, CPC, CTR and more.

- Refactored code given by @Aditya.
- Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.

## After LeapX

After working for 3 months with LeapX, there are some points I've want to discuss:

1. Just discontinue the internship and start focusing on personal projects and further learning and try to gather
   in-depth knowledge around Deep Learning concepts and more.
2. Continue the internship and start learning deep learning from **CampusX** side-by-side which will be a win-win
   situation best utilization of the time.
