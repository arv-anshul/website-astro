Finally, learning my ~~dream language~~ _(after using some top-notch projects written in it)_ **Rust**.

Created new [arv-anshul/thrust](https://github.com/arv-anshul/thrust) GitHub repo which contains my learning resources
and my practice progams. I have written some thoughts in the repo's
[`README.md`](https://github.com/arv-anshul/thrust#readme) file.

## Thoughts

### The Dream Language - Nightmare

Before learning Rust I imagine that this is my **Dream Language** _for sure_ but after digging into it I regret. Why I
started learning this. Because this is \*\*\*king hard too learn if you compare to Python (After this I think python has
reduced the complexities to 50-60% :pray:).

### The Learning Curve

My first language is **Python** and it very to learn because there is no concept of
[Ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html) and 69+ different data-types; just
write your code and run it. But in Rust the compiler says _aise kaise_.

### The Rust Compiler

Mera koti-koti naman unko jo iis compiler (`rustc`) ka chintan kiye aur ise itna safal banaya. Matlab `rustc` ko sab
pata hai ki aap kisko kya de rhe ho, kaise de rhe ho, sab kuch; inse kuch nhi chhipa hai. Agar kuch bhi idhar-udhar hua,
turant tok denga.

### Irritation

In the beginning, while creating programs or project it feels irritating; you have no idea how to do it there is so much
constraints to care about. _Sometimes I feels that I can build this in Python and that is enough for me. :angry:._
