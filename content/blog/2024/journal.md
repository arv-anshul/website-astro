# Dev Journal

I came to know about **Dev Journal** [from this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/hcQ7avj6Zrg).

## My Thought

It is a very easy and good way to review yourself on weekly basis. Using this you can keep track of your learning and
improvement.

## Convention

Using this I will be able to follow a set of instructions which helps me to write my Dev Journal in a pre-defined
manner.

> I have wrote snippets for this for
> [vscode](https://github.com/arv-anshul/diary/tree/main/.vscode/dev-journal.code-snippets).

1. Monthly journal file starts with `# Journal of <month-name>`.
2. Journal will'be maintain on weekly basis.
3. Weekly Journal titled as `## Week <week-num> Journal`.
4. Weekly Section doesn't contains any other sub-section.

## Tips (using `ollama`)

- Focus on the tasks that you completed during the week and what you learned from them.
- Don't be afraid to include any mistakes or errors that you made during the week. It helps to learn and improve from
  them.
- Use this as an opportunity to reflect on your progress and identify areas for improvement.
- Keep your journal entries concise and focused, around one page or less.
- Consider sharing your journal entries with a mentor or colleague for feedback and support.
