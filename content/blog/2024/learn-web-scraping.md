Web scraping is a very essential tool for programmers to learn to gather data from websites. Specifically, for Data
Scientists web scraping is goto tool to gather data from websites. We can use `bs4.BeautifulSoup` or `selenium` in
Python to scrape any website.

You can see some of my projects where I scraped websites like [99acres.com](https://99acres.com),
[flipkart.com](https://flipkart.com), [housing.com](https://housin.com) and gather useful data for my Data Science
projects like [arv-anshul/campusx-real-estate](https://github.com/arv-anshul/campusx-real-estate).

If you follow/learn these resources then you will understand how do Web Scraping works and how to do it.

## My Python Package for Web Scraping

I have done lots of project on Web Scraping but while doing those web scraping projects I doesn't found a good python
package to handle/parse cURL command. But I found a package called [@spulec/uncurl](https://github.com/spulec/uncurl) on
GitHub but it is managed badly so that I cloned that project and refactor it well and republished as
[`curler` on PyPI](https://pypi.org/p/curler).
