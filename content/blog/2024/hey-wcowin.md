I had opened a [discussion] in [mkdocs-material] GitHub repo and tomorrow and [@Wcowin] wrote a comment on that
[discussion] and I replied him generously. After my reply **he followed me** and this makes me curious; **"Why/How any
random guy can follow me?"** Because I can't do this to anybody.

Then, I started exploring his GitHub account and visited his [personal website] and that website is just wonderful place
because that **palace** contains tons of thoughts :star_struck: of him.

I am thankful that I met you and thankful to you that you shared your thoughts like this and I'm able to read it (after
translation). I am thankful to you that you met me and also looking forward to your next thoughts.

**Meet you at your next thought.**

I am searching his [Friends page][friends] on his website (but navigating with Chinese language) but into his
[Blog page][blog] and after scrolling a bit **I read my name (Anshul Raj Verma)** because others words were written in
Chinese which got my focus to my name. After sudden realization I copied the sentence and pasted it on
[Google Translate] and came to know that he wrote:

> [!IMPORTANT] Translation
>
> **In Chinese**: 感谢Anshul Raj Verma在Discussions#7上提出的网站优化建议
>
> **In Hindi**: चर्चा#7 में वेबसाइट अनुकूलन सुझावों के लिए अंशुल राज वर्मा को धन्यवाद
>
> **In English**: Thanks to [Anshul Raj Verma] for his website optimization suggestions in [Discussions#7]
