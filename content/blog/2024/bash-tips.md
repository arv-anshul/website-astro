This page contains some Tips and Tricks which are helpful to work with Bash scripts or Terminals. I have mentioned only
those tips and tricks which I uses most in my daily routine, BTW you can refer to links which I have shared to know all
the tips and tricks.

### Command: `!!`

A substitution which contains the previous command, some useful invocations.

```bash
$ ls /proc/1/exe
ls: cannot access '/proc/1/exe': Permission denied

$ sudo !!
sudo ls /proc/1/exe
/proc/1/exe
```

```bash
$ ls /tmp/ | grep sys
systemd-private-e21be514f23449189063b6bd95ec13ef-bolt.service-MCMIaN
systemd-private-e21be514f23449189063b6bd95ec13ef-colord.service-yNWr06
systemd-private-e21be514f23449189063b6bd95ec13ef-fwupd.service-geozA1

$ watch "!!"
watch "ls /tmp/ | grep sys"
(opens up watch panel)
```

### Command: `!$`

A substitution which contains the last segment of the previous command.

```bash
$ $EDITOR test.py

$ python !$
python test.py
Hello world!
```

```bash
mkdir new-project
code !$  # Opens the `new-project folder in VSCode
```

### Shortcut: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>\</Kbd>

<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>\</kbd> sends `SIGQUIT` (**default behavior:** terminate + produce a core dump) which can be
useful to kill things that normally catch <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> (`SIGINT`).

> :fire: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>\</kbd> is more powerful than <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>.

## Additional Tricks

### Trick: `` cmd `!!` ``

- Run previous command with new command.
- Replace previous command with `` `!!` `` argument.

```bash
$ brew --prefix
/opt/homebrew

$ open `!!`
open `brew --prefix`
# Now Finder.app opens at "/opt/homebrew" path
```
