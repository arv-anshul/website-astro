On 08 January _exact_ 08 AM, I got a mail to reset my GitHub account due to suspicious activity. I am like what, how,
who? But I certainly did as being said. And I thought that's it and it's all good now.

At same evening I raised an issue in other's public repo. I thought it was a success but when I get back into that
repo's issue tab I am not able to see my issue. So I thought it might be got missed _(which didn't happened before)_, I
may raise another but I thought I should check once to confirm.

Somehow, I figured out that it was opened but none can see it except me. Then my mind tricks, it may have happened by
that today's suspension.

I go to mails' Trash tabs _(because I deleted that email)_, restores it and read it again from start word-by-word. I
checked account's security logs there nothing suspicious expect that suspend, unsuspend, and oauth key terminations.

I reached to GitHub Support and raised a ticket to resolve this issue.

They said to create new account and use it. I was like what, why? What did I done wrong? Tell me.

They said the GitHub System suspected that my account is used distribute malware. :salute:

I insisted and told to review my account manually, there is nothing suspicious. This account is important for me. I
haven't created another because I know I haven't done anything wrong.

They said it was your arv-anshul/dotfiles repository which is convicted and you should either delete it or privatize it.
So I changed the visibility of the repository to PRIVATE.

And hence, the support team cleared the restrictions from my account. :finally:

Thanks.
